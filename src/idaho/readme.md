# Jordan Scrapes Secretary of States: Idaho

This package has some sample code getting data from the [Idaho Secretary of Search Business Search](https://sosbiz.idaho.gov/search/business). 

Upon discovering that North Dakota uses the same software for their businesses database, the main functions doing the work have been abstracted to the [businesssearch-helpers](https://github.com/aarmora/jordan-scrapes-secretary-of-states/tree/master/src/businesssearch-helpers) section.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`. 

After that, you just need to run `npm start`.
