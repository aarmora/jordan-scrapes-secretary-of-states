# Jordan Scrapes Secretary of States: Delaware

This package has some sample code getting data from the [Delaware Secretary of Search Business Search](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx). 

To be honest, this only does an okay job. I think the code is good but Delaware has really made it a mess to do any kind of searching. Even if you weren't trying to automate it, it's still a pain to do any kind of searching.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`. 

After that, you just need to run `npm start`.
